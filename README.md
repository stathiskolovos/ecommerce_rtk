# Lab: E-Commerce Data Rendering using React Toolkit

In this lab, you will learn how to use Redux Toolkit to manage state throughout your entire application in such a way that it can be accessed by any component without following the hierarchy between the components. You will build a simple E-Commerce application using React and Redux where you will display a list of products with an "Add to Cart" button for each product, display the items added to the cart, and allow users to remove items from the cart. All this information is going to be globally available throughout the application using Redux Toolkit.

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Integrate React components with Redux for state management
2. Implement basic E-Commerce features such as adding items to the cart, removing items from the cart, and clearing the cart
3. Practice composing multiple React components to build a cohesive user interface
